# Project Brain

**If you only read one file in this repo, read this one.** It's the
orientation index — where things stand, and where to go for detail. Meant
to be read cold by a new session, a new machine, or a future you who's
forgotten the details.

## What this is

Master Agent: an AI orchestration platform that turns a stated intention
into a completed, verified outcome, instead of the human manually
managing multiple AI tools. See `WHY.md` for the reasoning, `MANIFESTO.md`
for the values, `PRODUCT_PRINCIPLES.md` for the engineering rules those
values imply.

## Where things stand right now (2026-07-23)

- **The architecture is designed and documented**, not just implemented
  ad hoc: `ARCHITECTURE.md` is the system design; `docs/adr/` explains
  *why* each major choice was made.
- **Mission Brief 001 is real and working**: one full mission
  ("create a folder called Demo") runs end to end through the actual
  Orchestrator, Permission System, and Mission state machine — not a
  mock. Full detail and an honest "what's production-ready vs. still a
  stub" accounting: `docs/MISSION_BRIEF_001.md`.
- **Mission Brief 001.5** added the founder-workspace scaffolding — top-
  level runtime folders, this documentation set, the Obsidian vault, git —
  around the working code, without touching the code itself.
- **Mission Brief 002 generalized execution**: a `LocalExecutor` +
  `Action` contract now sits between the Orchestrator and the filesystem,
  so every future local capability (read/rename/delete/copy/move file,
  run PowerShell/CMD, git, VS Code, Obsidian, ...) plugs into the same
  validated, permission-gated, logged execution path instead of being a
  one-off special case. `create_folder` was refactored onto it with zero
  functional regression (same transcript, same tests passing). Full
  detail: `docs/MISSION_BRIEF_002.md`.
- **Mission Brief 003 proved composition**: added `write_file` (a second
  filesystem primitive) and `WorkspaceBootstrapAction` (a composite —
  root folder + subfolders + seed files, generically parameterized, not
  a hardcoded script) that composes `create_folder`/`write_file` calls
  *through* the real `LocalExecutor.execute()` path, never by calling
  their `run()` methods directly — every sub-step stays validated,
  permission-gated (via a relayed grant, extending ADR-0005's pattern —
  see ADR-0006), and logged. No transactional rollback on partial
  failure, flagged as known debt rather than silently accepted. 76 tests
  pass. Full detail: `docs/MISSION_BRIEF_003.md`.
- **What's still a stub, unchanged:** Planner (real model-driven
  planning — `workspace_bootstrap` has no real intent wired to it yet,
  see Mission Brief 003's recommendation), Mission Manager (persistence +
  multi-mission lifecycle), Model Router wiring to live providers, Memory
  persistence, Voice I/O, Desktop UI, and every local action besides
  `create_folder`/`write_file`/`workspace_bootstrap` (the Executor now
  supports adding them cheaply, but none are built yet). See `ROADMAP.md`
  for what's next and in what order.

## Where to go for what

| Question | File |
|---|---|
| Why does this exist? | `WHY.md` |
| What do we value / what tradeoffs does that force? | `MANIFESTO.md`, `PRODUCT_PRINCIPLES.md` |
| How is the system designed? | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Why was each design choice made? | `docs/adr/*.md`, summarized in `DECISIONS.md` |
| What's actually built and working right now? | `docs/MISSION_BRIEF_001.md`, `docs/MISSION_BRIEF_002.md`, `docs/MISSION_BRIEF_003.md` |
| How does a new local capability plug in? | `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.7, `docs/MISSION_BRIEF_002.md` |
| How does a *composite* mission (several actions together) plug in? | `docs/MISSION_BRIEF_003.md`, `docs/adr/0006-composite-action-relay.md` |
| What's next, and in what order? | `ROADMAP.md` |
| What's known/unknown about the founder and constraints? | `FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md` |
| How do I set this up on a new machine? | `START_HERE.md` |
| Is the deadline realistic? | `docs/TIMELINE_RISK.md` |
| Raw, unstructured notes / journal / research | `obsidian/` vault |

## Standing constraints worth repeating

- **Local-first architecture, cloud enhancement when beneficial.**
- **Human approval before important actions** — non-negotiable, and the
  approval UX itself has to stay simple (see the tension named in
  `MANIFESTO.md`).
- **Reuse existing scaffolding; don't refactor architecture without being
  asked; don't delete without approval.** Every mission brief so far has
  honored this — check `DECISIONS.md` before assuming a module needs
  rebuilding rather than reusing.
- **"Minimum Manual Work. Maximum Agent Work."** The recurring philosophy
  across every brief — the agent does the execution, the founder
  approves and directs.
